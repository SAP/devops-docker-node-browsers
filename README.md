# Node Browsers Image

This [_Dockerfile_](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) can be used in _Continuous Delivery_ (CD) pipelines for SAP development projects.
The image is optimized for use with project ["Piper"](https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library) on [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/).
Docker containers simplify your CD tool setup, encapsulating tools and environments that are required to execute pipeline steps.

If you want to learn how to use project "Piper" please have a look at [the documentation](https://github.com/SAP/jenkins-library/blob/master/README.md).
Introductory material and a lot of SAP scenarios not covered by project "Piper" are described in our [Continuous Integration Best Practices](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/ci-best-practices-intro.html).
